									<p class="">Block Printing can be distinguished into two categories, The Sanganeri and Bagru prints. Although much difference is not noted, but the background color of the Fabric marks the difference between the two. The Sanganeri prints are done on a white background and the Bagru prints are essentially done on background of red and black. Block Printing of Rajasthan in India is known for the intricate designs and the details that are made on the block prints. Block printing is done on rich and vibrant colors and this aspect has given prominence to Block Printing as a craft of Rajasthan.</p>
									<p>The wooden blocks of different shapes and sizes used for block printing are called bunta. The base of the block has the design carved on it. The fabric is washed free of starch before printing is done on it. Printing is done from left to right. Standard colors used for block printing are black, brown, orange, red, and mustard. The fabric is dried out in the sun after the block printing is done.</p>
									<p>A block maker or a carpenter who specializes in block making is called “Bhatt-ghar“- in Rajasthan. Here Bhatt implies block and the ghar implies the carver. The block printers of Saanganer get most of their blocks made in Purani Basti in Jaipur. Those blocks that need some special technical input are usually sent to Farukhabaad, Sitapur, Meerut or Pilakuan in UP or Pethapur in Gujarat.</p>

									<h2>Bandari Silk</h2>
									<p>Famed across the world for their softness, warmth and the artistic attention to detail, they are worth the high price they command. Not only do they insulate well, but they’re also lightweight. Adornments include frills and embroidery. They are fluffy, and traditionally use 100 % pure, finely combed cotton with a high thread count and double stitching.</p>
									<p>Tiny, incredibly precise designs are achieved in cloth by plucking and tying a thread to reveal artwork in bright shades of like vermillion, saffron, emerald, sapphire, and yellow yields. Along with style, there is also symbolism here – red can represent a Hindu bride, and yellow signifies maternity. Bandhini use is common on turbans, dupattas, and sarees, in accompaniment with embroidery, mirror-work, and appliqué.</p>

									<h2>Leheriya</h2>
									
									<p>Named after flowing waves of water, Leheriya work focuses on clear patterns, created on thin cotton or silk cloth, for turbans or saris. Authentic Leheriya fabric is sold with the knots (used for dyeing) still in place.</p>
									<p>Rajasthan’s most popular hub of block and screen printing is Sanganer, famed for its sheer variety of folk patterns on white cotton. It is great for home linens and furnishing, including bed covers, table cloths etc. These motifs are made with thin black outlines and the use of red dye to colour figures and flowers.</p>

									<h2> Barmeri Prints</h2>
									<p>Bold geometric prints are what set Barmer’s prints apart from the rest of Rajasthani textiles. Additionally, unlike the light floral colours, Barmer fabrics show darker shades as it takes inspiration from the Barmer’s location in the Thar Desert, where locals believe dark shades are cooler.</p>

										<p class="a">In contrast to the predominant white clothing of the lush green areas of the southern and western India, in Rajasthan the glowing red and yellow odanies or turban is valued as an affirmation of life in the face of hardship and deprivation of the most basic kind.</p>
